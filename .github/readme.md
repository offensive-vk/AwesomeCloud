## What is Cloud Exactly ?

The cloud is an extensive network of remote servers around the world. These servers store and manage data, run applications, and deliver content and services like streaming videos, web mail, and office productivity software over the internet.

## What is Cloud Computing ?

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet ("the cloud"). Cloud computing offers a more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective way to access and manage computing resources compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.

There are various types of cloud services:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Providers offer virtualized computing resources over the internet, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking.

- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Providers offer platforms that allow customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.

- Software as a Service (SaaS): Providers offer software applications over the internet, typically on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for users to install and maintain the software locally.
