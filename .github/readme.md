## What is Cloud Exactly ?

The cloud is an extensive network of remote servers around the world. These servers store and manage data, run applications, and deliver content and services like streaming videos, web mail, and office productivity software over the internet.

## What is Cloud Computing ?

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet ("the cloud"). Cloud computing offers a more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective way to access and manage computing resources compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.

There are various types of cloud services:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Providers offer virtualized computing resources over the internet, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking.

- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Providers offer platforms that allow customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.

- Software as a Service (SaaS): Providers offer software applications over the internet, typically on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for users to install and maintain the software locally.

## Top Cloud Providers

A cloud service provider rents out the combination of technology, infrastructure, and expertise to other companies and individuals for the purpose of cloud computing, including online storage, compute, and networking over the Internet. Some examples includes:

1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) – Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

2. Microsoft Azure – Hybrid cloud and enterprise cloud services.

3. Google Cloud Platform – AI, ML, and Kubernetes.

4. Alibaba — Largest cloud service provider in Asia.

5. IBM Cloud – Multi-cloud CSP
